**Type Annotations**

After the release of Java 8, annotations can be applied to any type of use. This means that annotations can be used anywhere we use a type. As an example, when creating a class instance using a new operator, typecasting, when implementing an interface using an implements clause, throws a clause, etc., this form of annotation is called a type annotation.

The purpose of this type of annotation is to support improved analysis of Java programs and ensure stronger type checking. Up to the Java 8 release, Java contained no type-checking framework, but using the type annotation, a type checking framework can be written and used in java program.
